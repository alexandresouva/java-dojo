    // ------------------------
    // ðŸš© Important notes:

    // - Association:
    //   This is an association between Player and Team classes.

    //   Types of association:
    //   - Unidirectional:
    //     Player knows the Team (this case). Team does NOT know the Player list.
    //
    //   - Bidirectional:
    //     Both Player and Team know about each other (would require Team class to have a list of Players).

    //   Cardinality examples:
    //   - 1:1 â†’ One Person has one Passport, and that Passport belongs to that Person.
    //   - 1:N â†’ One Team has many Players.
    //   - N:1 â†’ Many Players belong to the same Team.
    //   - N:N â†’ Many Students can enroll in many Courses, and each Course has many Students.
